</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>There are a handful of keys that I never touch—Scroll Lock, SysRq, F1 through F12, and that strange button with an unidentifiable glyph which doesn't seem to do anything.</p>
<p>Pause is another one of those keys.  Wouldn't it be nice if <code>pause</code> lived up to its name and could actually pause a video or music, regardless of which window is in focus?</p>
<p>Well, it can.  But that's not the interesting part.  This post showcases some curious functionality of zsh that ended up being surprisingly useful: the <code>zsocket</code> command.</p>
<h2>the setup</h2>
<p>My media player of choice, mpv, can be controlled by an external program through the use of a JSON IPC protocol.  Let's get started by enabling the necessary option in <code>mpv.conf</code>—it just takes a single line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpv-socket
</pre></div>


<p>Whenever we run mpv, it will start listening to <code>/tmp/mpv-socket</code> (creating the file if it doesn't already exist).  The man page for mpv describes its protocol in more detail, but the message for toggling the player's pause state is fairly straightforward: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{&quot;command&quot;: [&quot;cycle&quot;, &quot;pause&quot;]}
</pre></div>


<h2>the solution</h2>
<p>Now that the socket is open, we need to send our command.  Despite the fact that it looks like a file, we can't simply <code>echo</code> a string to the socket:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; echo &#39;{&quot;command&quot;: [&quot;cycle&quot;, &quot;pause&quot;]}&#39; &gt; /tmp/mpv-socket
zsh: no such device or address: /tmp/mpv-socket
</pre></div>


<p>mpv's man page recommends using <code>socat</code> to talk to the socket. That may be the easiest solution, but I'd rather not install an extra package on my system for a command that I only use in one place.</p>
<p>We could write a short program to do the job, but the Berkeley sockets API is a bit unwieldy for such a simple task.</p>
<p>Considering that this post is supposed to be about zsh, you already know where this is going.  Fine, let's see what zsh can do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>zmodload zsh/net/socket
zsocket /tmp/mpv-socket
print -u &quot;<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">REPLY</span><span class="cp">}</span>&quot; &#39;{&quot;command&quot;: [&quot;cycle&quot;, &quot;pause&quot;]}&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>Three lines, not too shabby!  It works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zmodload</code> loads zsh's socket module, which provides the <code>zsocket</code> function.</li>
<li><code>zsocket</code> opens the socket and stores its file descriptor in the variable REPLY.</li>
<li><code>print</code> writes our command to the socket. The <code>-u</code> option allows us to specify a file descriptor.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that's left is to wire up the pause key to run our script.  That process varies by desktop environment, so I'll leave the rest up to you.</p>
<h3>One last thing...</h3>
<p>If you think <code>zsocket</code> is neat, be sure to check out <code>ztcp</code> in the <code>zshmodules</code> man page.  Just as <code>zsocket</code> provides a simple way to communicate via Unix sockets, <code>ztcp</code> can be used to read and write Internet sockets.</p>
<p>Happy scripting!</p>
